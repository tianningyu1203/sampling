# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1. Sample type
2. Sample size
3. Target population
4. Sampling frame
5. Survey mode(s) 
6. Timeline
7. Response rate
8. Weights
9. Data processing
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
11. Sources of error
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Identify and describe survey features:

```
1. Sample type
    Combination of stratified, cross-sectional, and rejective sampling strategie
2. Sample size
   4430
3. Target population
    Individuals aged 15 years and older residing in private households across the ten Canadian provinces were included. The survey excluded residents of the Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and full-time residents of institutions.
4. Sampling frame
    This survey uses a frame that combines landline and cellular telephone numbers from the Census and various administrative sources with Statistics Canada's dwelling frame. Records on the frame are groups of one or several telephone numbers associated with the same address (or single telephone number in the case a link between a telephone number and an address could not be established)
5. Survey mode(s) 
   Data are collected directly from survey respondents either through an electronic questionnaire or through CATI (computer assisted telephone interviewing). No proxy reporting is allowed. The respondents has the choice between French and English.
6. Timeline
    2018-09-04 to 2018-12-28
7. Response rate
     41.9%
8. Weights
 WGHT_PER: This is the basic weighting factor for analysis at the person level, i.e. to calculate estimates of the number of persons (non-institutionalized and aged 15 or over) having one or several given characteristics. In addition to the estimation weights, bootstrap weights have been created for the purpose of design-based variance estimation.
9. Data processing
    Verification of data consistency and accuracy
    Coding of open-ended responses
    Editing to correct identifiable errors
    Imputation for missing or inconsistent responses
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
    Data cleaning involved identifying and rectifying inconsistencies or errors in the responses. Imputation methods were applied to handle missing data, ensuring completeness of the dataset. 
11. Sources of error
    Sampling Error: Variability that arises because a sample, rather than the entire population, was surveyed.
    Non-sampling Error: Errors not related to the sampling process, such as measurement errors, data processing errors, and non-response bias.
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
    Exclusion of certain populations: Residents of the territories and institutionalized individuals were not surveyed, which may affect the generalizability of results to these groups.

    Mode Effects: Differences in responses between telephone and online modes could introduce variability.

13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used
